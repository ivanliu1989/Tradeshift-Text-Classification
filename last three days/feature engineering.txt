feature engineering:
	1.categorial features less than 50000 distinct values are given one-hot encoding
	2.others are hash encoding

1st Purpose: generate features for GBDT
	1.all numerical features are included
	2.categorial features that appear more than 4m times are included
	3.categorial features less than 10 times are transformed into a sepcial value.
	4.previous model features are included

2nd
	1.grouping hierarchical features
	2.detect collinear features

4th
	1.feature reduction by encoding all rare feature values with one code
	2.features with less than 10K distinct values are one-hot encoded which are better than hashing
	3.long tail features are log-transformed
